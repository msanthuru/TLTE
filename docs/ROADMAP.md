# Roadmap

## Purpose

This roadmap outlines the **directional phases** of the TLTE / VinMin
framework.

It is intentionally **non-time-bound** and **non-exhaustive**, reflecting
the project’s long-term, adaptive nature rather than fixed milestones.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation

Focus:
- establish core principles and documentation
- define governance philosophy and boundaries
- create initial digital presence and tooling scaffolding
- validate community interest and participation patterns

Key outcomes:
- clear structure and intent
- stable public-facing framework
- disciplined separation of public and internal systems

---

## Phase 2 — Participation

Focus:
- expand community participation
- introduce contribution pathways
- support early creators, educators, and organisers
- refine membership and access models

Key outcomes:
- active contributor base
- repeat engagement loops
- trust-building through consistent behaviour and transparency

---

## Phase 3 — Services and Value

Focus:
- introduce ecosystem services and partnerships
- support internal value circulation
- enable practical use-cases for members and contributors
- refine platform usability

Key outcomes:
- increased utility and retention
- diversified participation roles
- sustainable operational patterns

---

## Phase 4 — Physical Nodes

Focus:
- establish physical hubs or nodes where appropriate
- apply standardised node playbooks
- integrate digital and physical participation
- support local adaptation within shared standards

Key outcomes:
- stronger trust anchors
- real-world visibility and legitimacy
- replicable node model

---

## Phase 5 — Replication and Maturity

Focus:
- replicate successful models across locations
- strengthen governance continuity
- support leadership expansion responsibly
- ensure long-term resilience and adaptability

Key outcomes:
- decentralised but coherent ecosystem
- institutional durability
- reduced dependence on any single contributor or entity

---

## Ongoing Priorities

Across all phases, TLTE / VinMin prioritises:
- transparency
- security through structure
- cultural respect and preservation
- ethical growth
- sustainability over speed

---

## Summary

The TLTE / VinMin roadmap represents a **long-arc framework** rather than a
short-term project plan.

Progress is measured by **stability, trust, and usefulness**, not rapid
expansion alone.
