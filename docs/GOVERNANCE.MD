# Governance

## Purpose

This document outlines the **governance philosophy** of the TLTE / VinMin
framework.

It describes how rules, responsibility, accountability, and continuity are
approached at a high level, without detailing internal or sensitive processes.

---

## Governance Principles

Governance within TLTE / VinMin is designed to be:

- rule-based rather than personality-based
- transparent and auditable
- resistant to concentration of power
- adaptable over time
- aligned with long-term community interest

The framework prioritises **institutional stability** over rapid decision-making.

---

## Roles and Responsibility

Participation within the ecosystem may involve different roles, such as:
- contributors
- maintainers
- operators
- coordinators
- partners

Roles are defined by **responsibility and trust**, not status.
Higher responsibility implies higher accountability.

---

## Decision-Making

Decisions are guided by:
- documented rules and standards
- impact assessment
- long-term sustainability
- community trust considerations

No single individual is intended to have unchecked authority.

---

## Accountability

Accountability is maintained through:
- clear role definitions
- documented processes
- review and escalation mechanisms
- separation of duties where appropriate

Actions that affect the ecosystem are expected to be explainable and reviewable.

---

## Continuity and Evolution

The governance model is designed to:
- outlive individual contributors
- allow responsible expansion of leadership
- support succession without disruption
- evolve through structured change, not sudden shifts

Governance changes are treated as **system-level decisions**.

---

## Public vs Internal Governance

This document describes the **public-facing governance philosophy** only.

Detailed internal procedures, enforcement mechanisms, and sensitive governance
operations are intentionally excluded from this repository.

---

## Summary

TLTE / VinMin governance exists to **protect the ecosystem**, not to control
participants.

Its primary goal is to ensure fairness, trust, resilience, and long-term
viability.
