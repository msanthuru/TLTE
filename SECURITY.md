# TLTE C.I.C. · Security Policy

TLTE C.I.C. is committed to maintaining a safe, secure, and responsible
open-source environment. This document outlines how security issues should be
reported for all public-facing repositories under TLTE C.I.C. and TLTE Cloud.

---

## 🛡️ 1. Supported Versions

Public repositories may include modules, utilities, or documentation that are
actively maintained. Security reports are accepted for:

- Current main branch  
- Any actively used public modules  
- Code that is part of official TLTE C.I.C. releases  

Private and internal systems are maintained separately and are **not**
represented in this repository.

---

## 🚨 2. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, **do not** create a public GitHub issue.

Instead, report it privately to:

📧 **security@tlte.cloud**  
(If unavailable, use **info@tlte.cloud**)

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
- Severity level (your assessment)  
- Any possible fixes or suggestions  

Reports will be kept confidential.

## 🔒 3. Non-Public Systems

This repository does **not** contain:

- internal infrastructure  
- access-control logic  
- identity systems  
- operational tooling  
- governance systems  
- region-sensitive or security-sensitive code  

These remain private in secure environments.

---

## 🤝 4. Responsible Disclosure

We request that contributors:

- Avoid scanning for vulnerabilities outside the scope of this repository  
- Refrain from testing against private or internal systems  
- Do not disclose any findings publicly until TLTE C.I.C. has reviewed them  

Responsible disclosure protects both contributors and the community.

---

## 🛠️ 5. Our Commitment

Upon receiving a report, TLTE C.I.C. will:

- Review the issue promptly  
- Assess potential impact  
- Respond with next steps  
- Provide updates until resolution  
- Credit contributors where appropriate
