# Scripts

This directory contains **utility and automation scripts** used to support
the TLTE / VinMin ecosystem.

## Purpose

Scripts in this folder may include:
- setup and bootstrap helpers
- maintenance and housekeeping tools
- data preparation or migration scripts
- build and deployment helpers
- monitoring or reporting utilities

## Scope

Only **non-sensitive, non-security-critical** scripts are included here.
All private, internal, or security-sensitive automation is intentionally
kept outside of this public repository.

## Notes

Scripts may evolve over time as the platform grows.
Contributions should follow the repository’s governance and contribution
guidelines.
