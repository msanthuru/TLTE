# utils/

This directory contains utility functions and helper modules used across the
public-safe components of the VinMin project under TLTE C.I.C.

Utilities placed here should be:

- generic and reusable  
- safe for open-source release  
- not tied to any private internal systems  
- free of sensitive data or logic  

Examples that may belong here:

- input validators  
- formatting helpers  
- type checkers  
- safe data transformation functions  
- general-purpose utilities  

Any utilities related to internal TLTE C.I.C. systems, identity logic,
security operations, or region-sensitive processes must remain private and
should not be placed here.
