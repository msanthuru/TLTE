# System Overview

## Purpose

This document describes the **high-level architecture** of the TLTE / VinMin
framework. It is intended to provide clarity on how the ecosystem is structured
without exposing private or security-sensitive details.

The architecture prioritises **modularity, resilience, and scalability**.

---

## Architectural Philosophy

TLTE / VinMin is designed as a **layered system**, where each layer has a
distinct responsibility and can evolve independently.

Key design goals:
- separation of concerns
- minimal coupling between components
- ability to add or remove modules without breaking the core
- clear boundaries between public, member, and restricted systems

---

## Core Layers

### 1. Community Layer

The community layer represents people and participation:
- membership identity
- contribution and reputation
- community interaction
- cultural and educational engagement

This layer focuses on **trust, behaviour, and collaboration**.

---

### 2. Governance Layer

The governance layer defines how decisions, standards, and accountability
operate within the framework.

It includes:
- rules and codes of conduct
- participation guidelines
- dispute resolution concepts
- role and responsibility structures

Governance is designed to be **transparent, rule-based, and durable**.

---

### 3. Platform Layer

The platform layer includes digital tools and interfaces that support
the ecosystem, such as:
- dashboards and portals
- content and collaboration tools
- service discovery and booking systems
- analytics and reporting (non-sensitive)

This layer focuses on **usability and reliability**.

---

### 4. Value & Services Layer

This layer represents internal value exchange and services:
- memberships and access tiers
- partner services and offerings
- rewards and participation incentives
- internal marketplace concepts

The emphasis is on **closed-loop value circulation** within the ecosystem.

---

### 5. Physical Node Layer

Physical nodes (hubs) act as real-world anchors for the framework.

A node may include:
- community spaces
- learning and training facilities
- creator or collaboration areas
- partner-operated services

Nodes follow a **standardised playbook** so they can be replicated across
locations while adapting to local needs.

---

## Public vs Internal Boundaries

The system is intentionally split into:
- **public-facing documentation and concepts**
- **member-only systems**
- **restricted internal infrastructure**

This repository documents only the public-facing aspects.

---

## Evolution

The architecture is designed to evolve gradually:
- new modules can be added over time
- governance structures can expand responsibly
- physical and digital layers can scale independently

Change is guided by **stability first, growth second**.

---

## Summary

TLTE / VinMin operates as a **multi-layered community framework** rather than
a single application or organisation.

Its strength lies in:
- clear structure
- disciplined boundaries
- repeatable design
- long-term thinking
